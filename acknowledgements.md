# Acknowledgements

There are several people, projects, groups and ideas to whom we owe much credit
and thanks:

## Brandon Sanderson

We hope that Brandon feels and hears our high esteem for his incredible work and
believes that we never intend to profit off of its back nor to violate his
intellectual property, only to honor it for its breadth and depth. If Brandon,
or more likely someone from his team or estate, would like to discuss anything
at all with the game team, please reach out at `<redacted>`, publicly or
privately, and expect a prompt and cooperative reply.

## Elixir

Without the incredible design and engineering efforts by Jose Valim and the rest
of the Elixir core team, this project would not be where it is today.

## Mud Coders Guild

The Mud Coders Guild represents a great source of inspiration, renewed passion,
camaraderie, design feedback and the best kinds of challenging each other to do
better. Without the energy that the MCG has continually injected into this
project, it would be languishing in a dead Git repository somewhere unnoticed.
